## Objective

## Game Play

After the player starts a new game, the player will be presented with a puzzle of blanks representing letters. A category related to the puzzle will also be presented. Next, the player will guess a letter. If the guessed letter is in the puzzle, then the puzzle will reappear with the guessed letter replaces all blank spots where that letter should go. If player guesses a letter that is not in the puzzle, the player receives a strike. This will continue until the player completes the puzzle or the player receives a predefined number of strikes.
